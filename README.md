Small and neat Rocket game. Can you handle the rocket?
Your mission is to guide the rocket from starting point to landing pad. Hitting walls is not fatal (yet) but yu need to land carefully.
You can add trust by pressing arrow UP
You can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise with right and left arrows respectively. Rotating adds also some thrust since it requires rockets to operate.
