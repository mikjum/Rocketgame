Small and neat Rocket game. Can you handle the rocket?
Your mission is to guide the rocket from starting point to landing pad. Hitting walls is not fatal (yet) but yu need to land carefully.

Controls from keyboard:
UP     Activates main thruster to push your rocket forward
LEFT   Activates right side thruster to rotate the rocket counterclockwice and slightly push forward as well
RIGHT  Activates left side thruster to rotate rocket clockwise and slightly push forward


And yes! The project is still ongoing. Todo-list contains at least:

1. Workaround to make hitbox smaller. Current hitbox is directly the sprite rect, which matches with surface and is hence too bigSmall
2. Add some effects on hits woth walls
3. Hitting the walls is built with dumb workaround, since there was no good way to detect collision directionSmall. Shall be fixed.
